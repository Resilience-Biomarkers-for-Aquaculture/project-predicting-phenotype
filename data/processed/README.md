# Processed gene count matrices
This folder contains normalized gene count matrices and sample groupings generated from the raw count data in `../external`.

- `.normalized.tsv` files: normalized gene counts for each sample
- `sample_groups_*.csv`: sample group assignments for 2-5 clusters

See `../../scripts/normalize_and_group.py` for processing details.
